# Final Project- Interactive Graphics and Critical Code

Name: Soren Chargois

## Project: A Life in De Stijl

### Conceptual Description

Replace with a description of the critical / conceptual dimensions of your project. What is your project about? What issues/topics are you engaging with. What should the user take away from your piece? 

I am going to be continuing with my interaction project from the second week of class. I want to bring this semester full circle by ending with a similar but more complex and interesting version of the first project. Originally, I was exploring the parallels between the era of De Stijl art in post-war Netherlands and the modern day tumultuous political climate. The Art Story website explains, "Like other avant-garde movements of the time, De Stijl, which means simply "the style" in Dutch, emerged largely in response to the horrors of World War I and the wish to remake society in its aftermath. Viewing art as a means of social and spiritual redemption, the members of De Stijl embraced a utopian vision of art and its transformative potential."

Originally this project was static, simply a strong visual representation of a coping mechanism in response to the toxic political and social climate in the United States. For the final project, I want to take the next step in using interaction to allow users to become a part of the art by partaking in a "create your own experience" artwork.

### Interaction Description

Replace with a description of the interactive dimensions of your project.  How do you expect users to interact with your piece. How is your piece to be set up in physical space? Who is the intended audience? How does your piece inform the user through interaction or amplifies those your project's main concepts and ideas?

So, for the final, I'm going to begin with the same general outline of the De Stijl piece found below. 

### Extension 

Do you intend to extend a piece that you've created throughout the semester? What elements are you adding or subtracting from the previous piece? How do these extensions/subtractions further develop the conceptual and interactive elements of your work?
